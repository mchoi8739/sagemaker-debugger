smdebug.trials
==============

An SMDebug trial is an object which lets you query for tensors for a given training
job, specified by the path where smdebug’s artifacts are saved. Trial is
capable of loading new tensors as and when they become available at the
given path, allowing you to do both offline as well as realtime
analysis.

.. autoclass:: smdebug.trials.create_trial

Path of trial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SageMaker training job
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running a SageMaker job this path is on S3. SageMaker saves data
from your training job locally on the training instance first and
uploads them to an S3 location in your account. When you start a
SageMaker training job with the python SDK, you can control this path
using the parameter ``s3_output_path`` in the ``DebuggerHookConfig``
object. This is an optional parameter, if you do not pass this the
python SDK will populate a default location for you. If you do pass
this, make sure the bucket is in the same region as where the training
job is running. If you’re not using the python SDK, set this path for
the parameter ``S3OutputPath`` in the ``DebugHookConfig`` section of
``CreateTrainingJob`` API. SageMaker takes this path and appends
training_job_name and “debug-output” to it to ensure we have a unique
path for each training job.

Non SageMaker training jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are not running a SageMaker training job, this is the path you
pass as ``out_dir`` when you create a smdebug
```Hook`` <api.md#hook>`__. Just like when creating the hook, you can
pass either a local path or an S3 path (as ``s3://bucket/prefix``).

Creating a trial object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two types of trials you can create: LocalTrial or S3Trial
depending on the path. We provide a wrapper method to create the
appropriate trial.

The parameters you have to provide are:

- ``path`` (str): A local path or an S3 path of the form ``s3://bucket/prefix``. You should see
  directories such as ``collections``, ``events`` and ``index`` at this
  path once the training job starts.

- ``name`` (str): A name for a trial.
  It is to help you manage different trials. This is an optional
  parameter, which defaults to the basename of the path if not passed.
  Please make sure to give it a unique name to prevent confusion.

Creating S3 trial
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

 from smdebug.trials import create_trial
 trial = create_trial(
   path='s3://smdebug-testing-bucket/outputs/resnet',
   name='resnet_training_run'
 )

Creating local trial
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

 from smdebug.trials import create_trial
 trial = create_trial(
   path='/home/ubuntu/smdebug_outputs/resnet',
   name='resnet_training_run'
 )

Restricting analysis to a range of steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can optionally pass ``range_steps`` to restrict your analysis to a
certain range of steps. Note that if you do so, Trial will not load data
from other steps.

**Examples**

- ``range_steps=(100, None)``: This will load all steps after 100

- ``range_steps=(None, 100)``: This will load all steps before 100

- ``range_steps=(100, 200)`` : This will load steps between 100 and 200

- ``range_steps=None``: This will load all steps

.. code:: python

 from smdebug.trials import create_trial
 trial = create_trial(
   path='s3://smdebug-testing-bucket/outputs/resnet',
   name='resnet_training',
   range_steps=(100, 200)
 )

~~~~~~~~~~

.. _steps-1:

steps
^^^^^

Query for the steps at which the given tensor was saved

.. code:: python

  trial.tensor(name).steps(mode=ModeKeys.GLOBAL, show_incomplete_steps=False)

.. _arguments-10:

Arguments
'''''''''

-  ``mode (smdebug.modes enum value)`` The mode whose steps to return
  for the given tensor. Defaults to ``modes.GLOBAL``
-  ``show_incomplete_steps (bool)`` This parameter is relevant only for
  distributed training. By default this method only returns the steps
  which have been received from all workers. But if this parameter is
  set to True, this method will return steps received from at least one
  worker.

.. _returns-13:

Returns
'''''''

``list[int]`` A list of steps at which the given tensor was saved

value
^^^^^

Get the value of the tensor at a given step as a numpy array

.. code:: python

  trial.tensor(name).value(step_num, mode=ModeKeys.GLOBAL, worker=None)

.. _arguments-11:

Arguments
'''''''''

-  ``step_num (int)`` The step number whose value is to be returned for
  the mode passed through the next parameter.
-  ``mode (smdebug.modes enum value)`` The mode applicable for the step
  number passed above. Defaults to ``modes.GLOBAL``
-  ``worker (str)`` This parameter is only applicable for distributed
  training. You can retrieve the value of the tensor from a specific
  worker by passing the worker name. You can query all the workers seen
  by the trial with the ``trial.workers()`` method. You might also be
  interested in querying the workers which saved a value for the tensor
  at a specific step, this is possible with the method:
  ``trial.tensor(name).workers(step, mode)``

.. _returns-14:

Returns
'''''''

``numpy.ndarray`` The value of tensor at the given step and worker (if
the training job saved data from multiple workers)

reduction_value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the reduction value of the chosen tensor at a particular step. A
reduction value is a tensor reduced to a single value through reduction
or aggregation operations. The different reductions you can query for
are the same as what are allowed in
`ReductionConfig <api.md#reductionconfig>`__ when saving tensors. This
API thus allows you to access the reduction you might have saved instead
of the full tensor. If you had saved the full tensor, it will calculate
the requested reduction at the time of this call.

Reduction names allowed are ``min``, ``max``, ``mean``, ``prod``,
``std``, ``sum``, ``variance`` and ``l1``, ``l2`` representing the
norms.

Each of these can be retrieved for the absolute value of the tensor or
the original tensor. Above was an example to get the mean of the
absolute value of the tensor. ``abs`` can be set to ``False`` if you
want to see the ``mean`` of the actual tensor.

If you had saved the tensor without any reduction, then you can retrieve
the actual tensor as a numpy array and compute any reduction you might
be interested in. In such a case you do not need this method.

.. code:: python

  trial.tensor(name).reduction_value(
    step_num,
    reduction_name,
    mode=modes.GLOBAL,
    worker=None,
    abs=False
  )

.. _arguments-12:

Arguments
'''''''''

-  ``step_num (int)`` The step number whose value is to be returned for
  the mode passed through the next parameter.
-  ``reduction_name (str)`` The name of the reduction to query for. This
  can be one of ``min``, ``max``, ``mean``, ``std``, ``variance``,
  ``sum``, ``prod`` and the norms ``l1``, ``l2``.
-  ``mode (smdebug.modes enum value)`` The mode applicable for the step
  number passed above. Defaults to ``modes.GLOBAL``
-  ``worker (str)`` This parameter is only applicable for distributed
  training. You can retrieve the value of the tensor from a specific
  worker by passing the worker name. You can query all the workers seen
  by the trial with the ``trial.workers()`` method. You might also be
  interested in querying the workers which saved a value for the tensor
  at a specific step, this is possible with the method:
  ``trial.tensor(name).workers(step, mode)``
-  ``abs (bool)`` If abs is True, this method tries to return the
  reduction passed through ``reduction_name`` after taking the absolute
  value of the tensor. It defaults to ``False``.

.. _returns-15:

Returns
'''''''

``numpy.ndarray`` The reduction value of tensor at the given step and
worker (if the training job saved data from multiple workers) as a 1x1
numpy array. If this reduction was saved for the tensor during training
as part of specification through reduction config, it will be loaded and
returned. If the given reduction was not saved then, but the full tensor
was saved, the reduction will be computed on the fly and returned. If
both the chosen reduction and full tensor are not available, this method
raises ``TensorUnavailableForStep`` exception.

shape
^^^^^

Get the shape of the chosen tensor at a particular step.

  the mode passed through the next parameter.
-  ``mode (smdebug.modes enum value)`` The mode applicable for the step
  number passed above. Defaults to ``modes.GLOBAL``
-  ``worker (str)`` This parameter is only applicable for distributed
  training. You can retrieve the value of the tensor from a specific
  worker by passing the worker name. You can query all the workers seen
  by the trial with the ``trial.workers()`` method. You might also be
  interested in querying the workers which saved a value for the tensor
  at a specific step, this is possible with the method:
  ``trial.tensor(name).workers(step, mode)``

.. _returns-16:

Returns
'''''''

- ``tuple(int)`` If only the shape of this tensor was saved through.
- ``save_shape`` configuration in ReductionConfig, it will be returned. If
  the full tensor was saved, then shape will be computed and returned
  today. If both the shape and full tensor are not available, this method
  raises ``TensorUnavailableForStep`` exception.

  by the trial with the ``trial.workers()`` method. You might also be
  interested in querying the workers which saved a value for the tensor
  at a specific step, this is possible with the method:
  ``trial.tensor(name).workers(step, mode)``

.. _returns-19:

Returns
'''''''

``dict[int -> tuple(int)]`` A dictionary with step numbers as keys and
tuples of ints representing the shapes of the tensor as values.

.. _workers-1:

workers
^^^^^^^

Get all the workers for which this tensor was saved at a given step

.. code:: python

  trial.tensor(name).workers(step_num, mode=modes.GLOBAL)

.. _arguments-17:

Arguments
'''''''''

-  ``step_num (int)`` The step number whose value is to be returned for
  the mode passed through the next parameter.
-  ``mode (smdebug.modes enum value)`` The mode applicable for the step
  number passed above. Defaults to ``modes.GLOBAL``

.. _returns-20:

Returns
'''''''

``list[str]`` A list of worker names for which the tensor was saved at
the given step.

prev_steps
^^^^^^^^^^

Get the last n step numbers of a given mode from a given step.

.. code:: python

  trial.tensor(name).prev_steps(step, n, mode=modes.GLOBAL)

.. _arguments-18:

Arguments
'''''''''

- ``step (int)`` The step number whose value is to be returned for the
  mode passed.
- ``n (int)`` Number of previous steps to return
- ``mode (smdebug.modes enum value)`` The mode applicable for the step
number passed above. Defaults to ``modes.GLOBAL``

.. _returns-21:

Returns
'''''''

``list[int]`` A list of size at most n representing the previous steps
for the given step and mode. Note that this list can be of size less
than n if there were only less than n steps saved before the given step
in this trial.
